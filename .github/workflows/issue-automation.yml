# =============================================================================
# Issue Automation
# =============================================================================
# Handles all issue lifecycle events and keeps the GitHub Project board in sync.
#
# Events handled:
#   - Issue opened    → Add to project board in "Todo" status, assign to creator
#   - Issue closed    → Move to "Done" (from ANY state: Todo, In Progress, In Review)
#   - Issue deleted   → Remove from project board
#   - Issue reopened  → Prevent: close again with comment (Law: we don't reopen issues)
#
# Note: Handles the "Closing an Issue Mid-Workflow" edge case — if an issue is
# closed while its card is in "In Progress" or "In Review", it moves to "Done".
